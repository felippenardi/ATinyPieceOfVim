              Hi, *|FNAME|*! I hope you still remember this email series of tiny vim tips you signed up to. It has been a couple of weeks I don't send you the weekly tips and I apologize for that. If you are not interested on it anymore, you can simply unsubscribe here. But if you are up to this week tip, it is going to be tiny and cool! :) Take a look:
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
              Have you ever had to retype a whole number just to increment or decrement it by one or a few unites? I'll show you a better way to do this. Vim has a built-in simple command in Normal Mode for adding and subtracting the number under the cursor by one unite: Ctrl+a and Ctrl+x.
            </p>

            <p>
              This commands really shines when you prescende it  with the number of times you want it to repeat. So, to increment a number under the cursor by 10, you just type 10 Ctrl+a. And to decrement it by 22, you just type 22 Ctrl+x.
            </p>

            </p>

            <p>
              Now, if you use Tmux with the Ctrl+a keybind — or you just find the default Vim keybind for this not intuitive enough — I have a suggestion for you: use Ctrl+j for decrement and Ctrl+k for increment. They are respectively the Vim moviment keys for going down and up. Here is what you need to add to your .vimrc to achieve this:

              I hope you enjoy this tiny tip, and thanks for staying with me  *|FNAME|* :)
            </p>

              This is the last Vim tip of the year and you can share it on twitter using this link and the hashtag #aTinyPieceOfVim — I would really love it!
            </p>
            Have an awesome New Year!,<br>
            See you in 2014!<br>
