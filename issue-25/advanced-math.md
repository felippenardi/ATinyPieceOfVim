Hey, *|FNAME|*!

Vim has a built-in command to increase and
decrease numbers. But what if you wan to do more
advanced mathmatics?

Instead of reaching your phone to do a quick
calculation, keep your fingers on your keyboard
homerow and try this:

```
!!bc
```

The double exclamation marks will get whatever is
in the current line and pass it to the bash
command you are about to type. In this case, bcâ€”a
programming language that calculates mathematic
expressions and is already built-in Linux and Mac. 


That means, this is the same thing as running
`echo "1+1" | bc` in your terminal.

Stay curious, *|FNAME|* :)
